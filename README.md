# Combustion-Hydrogen-Combustion-Simulation-with-OpenFOAM
The project focuses on modeling premixed flames and understanding ignition delay, flame propagation, and temperature distribution. The chemical kinetics of hydrogen combustion are handled using detailed reaction mechanisms, and simulation results are visualized to analyze the flame structure and thermal field.
